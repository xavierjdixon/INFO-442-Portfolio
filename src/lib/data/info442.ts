INFO 442 isn't your typical software engineering course. It's about learning how to build functional, values-aligned teams while also staying grounded in your identity and values. Rather than only focusing on productivity and deliverables, this course invites reflection on deeper concepts like psychological safety, boundaries, and systemic forces that shape team dynamics.

Instead of tests and midterms, our learning centered around two team-based projects. These projects combined technical skills (like front-end development, user interface design, and API integration) with reflective practices, peer feedback, and collaborative problem-solving.

From value alignment to vision-building, this class offered a space to understand what kind of work we want to doâ€”and how we want to show up in that work.

Key themes explored:
- Building psychologically safe and effective teams
- Identifying and addressing systemic forces that affect collaboration
- Integrating reflection and criticality into technical work
- Embracing identity and values in professional settings
- Reimagining grading and productivity through a values-based lens
