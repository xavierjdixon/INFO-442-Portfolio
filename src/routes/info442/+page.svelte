		INFO 442 isn’t your typical software engineering course. It invited us to think more deeply about how we work with others — not just as developers, but as people with values, needs, and limitations. The course emphasized <strong>psychological safety</strong>, <strong>value alignment</strong>, and <strong>team health</strong> over technical perfection — and that shift really changed how I approached building things.
	</p>

	<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 text-white">🍎 Project 1: Digital Fridge</h2>
	<p class="text-lg leading-8">
		For the first project, I really wanted to push myself technically — even if it was uncomfortable. I decided to build a full-stack app, even though I hadn’t done something like that before without guidance. I had to <strong>relearn how to connect a frontend to MongoDB</strong>, use new tools like Tailwind (which I’d never even heard of before), and manage all the moving parts that come with building an actual product.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-8">
		While I was proud of the progress I made technically, something didn’t feel right. The project — a “Digital Fridge” app — just didn’t resonate with me. It felt generic, and I realized I wasn’t building something I truly cared about. Despite working hard and staying engaged with my team, I felt disconnected. That was a big learning moment: <strong>just being “productive” doesn’t mean you’re fulfilled</strong>. This class helped me realize how important it is to work on things that align with my values and make me feel invested.
	</p>

	<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 text-white">🚏 Project 2: Transit Kiosk Concept</h2>
	<p class="text-lg leading-8">
		For the second project, I took a completely different approach. Instead of starting with the tech stack, I started with what mattered to me. I'm passionate about improving public transportation — especially in cities like Seattle, where the terrain can make mobility a real challenge. So my team and I designed an <strong>interactive kiosk</strong> for bus stops that gives people real-time updates, alternative travel options, and accessibility support.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-8">
		This project made me feel more connected — not just to the work, but to my team too. Because we all cared about the idea, our collaboration felt more natural and energized. <strong>Psychological safety</strong> became real here: we gave each other space to express ideas, take risks, and be honest when something wasn’t working. I wasn’t just writing code — I was contributing to a design that could actually make a difference.
	</p>

	<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 text-white">What I Took Away</h2>
	<ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg leading-8 pl-4">
		<li><strong>Growth comes from discomfort</strong> — my first project stretched me technically, even if it wasn’t perfect</li>
		<li><strong>Alignment matters</strong> — I build better things when I care about the problem I’m solving</li>
		<li><strong>Psychological safety isn’t just a buzzword</strong> — it’s what makes creative, honest teamwork possible</li>
		<li><strong>Success isn’t always about the output</strong> — it’s about the process, the reflection, and the connection</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="mt-10 text-sm text-gray-500 italic">
		This class gave me the space to not just improve as a developer, but to reflect on how I want to show up in team environments — and in the world. It taught me that being a great teammate isn’t about doing everything yourself, but about creating space where everyone can thrive.
